#summary How to install and run Google Refine

(If you have been using Freebase Gridworks 1.1, here are the [UpgradingTo2p0 upgrading instructions].)

Google Refine is a desktop application in that you download it, install it, and run it on your own computer. However, unlike most other desktop applications, it runs as a small web server on your own computer and you point your web browser at that web server in order to use Refine. So, think of Refine as a personal and private web application.

  # [http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/Downloads?tm=2 Download Google Refine here].
  # Install it as detailed below for your operation system.
  # As long as Google Refine is running, you can point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ to use it, and you can even use it in several browser tabs and windows.

===Windows===

*Install:* Once you have downloaded the .zip file, uncompress it into a folder wherever you want (such as in `C:\Google-Refine`).

*Run:* In that folder, run the `.exe` file in that folder. You should see the Command window in which Google Refine runs. By default, the Command window has a black background and text in monospace font in it.

*Shut down:* When you need to shut down Google Refine, switch to that Command window, and press `Ctrl-C`. Wait until there's a message that says the shutdown is complete. That window might close automatically, or you can close it yourself. If you get asked, "Terminate all batch processes? Y/N", just press Y.

===Mac OSX===

*Install:* once you have downloaded the .dmg file, open it, and drag the Google Refine icon into the Applications folder icon (just like you would normally install Mac applications).

*Run:* to launch Google Refine, go to the Applications folder and double click the Google Refine app. You'll see the Google Refine app appear in your dock.

*Shut down:* You can switch to the Google Refine app (clicking on its icon in the dock) and invoke its Quit command.

===Linux===

*Install / Run:* Once you have downloaded the `tar.gz` file, open a shell and type

{{{
  tar xzf google-refine.tar.gz
  cd google-refine
  ./refine
}}}

this will start Google Refine and open your browser to its starting page.

*Shut down:* Press `Ctrl-C` in the shell.
